# Project-1

You've been meeting with your client about their new website, and after getting a sense of their goals and the type of content they want to show, you've recommended the Agency template at https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/  .   
Your client likes the template as a starting point and has asked for the following layout modifications:
Make the top section a carousel similar to the Modern Business template https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-modern-business/  ; 

1) but your client wants 4 items in the carousel.
2) Add a second row of services; 
3) Make the portfolio section show two items per row instead of three;
4) Add another item to the About section;
5) Add another Section titled "Coming Soon" before the Contact section;  this section should have the proper alternating background color and the same type of headline.   And it should be linked in the nav bar at the top.

Your client is working on marketing copy and images, but they are not ready yet.
You've decided not to host local versions of Bootstrap, jQuery, Popper, etc. but to use files hosted on content delivery networks when possible.  

Coincidentally, your client's marketing color palette is the same as that of the University of Illinois - Chicago which can be found at http://marketing.uic.edu/marketing-toolbox/university-style-guide/visual-elements/
